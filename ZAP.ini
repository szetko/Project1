Using ZAP for web security
Working through the pentester example web applications was interesting while using ZAP.
I found that ZAP was unable to find some vulnerabilities for certain webpages although there were definitely high-risk
vulnerabilities available to use. These vulnerabilities i found from searching the web. This shows me that 
ZAP is not 100% effective when performing web application audits. 

- Running and using ZAP
- Download the latest version of ZAP
- Ensure Java is installed 
- Use 'Quick Start' and enter the URL to attack in the url bar - Press 'Attack'
- To use a proxy server while using zap on a browser use the address 'localhost' port number '8080'
- Once the scans have been completed click 'Alerts'
- Search through the 'Alerts' folder for any vulnerabilities listed.
- General infomation is available when cliking through each alert.
